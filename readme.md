# 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text using BERT

This project detects **6 emotions** (joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, surprise) from user input text using a fine-tuned BERT model trained on the **Crowdflower Emotion Dataset**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

A Colab-based ML pipeline that:

* Preprocesses and tokenizes text data
* Fine-tunes a BERT model using Hugging Face Transformers
* Deploys a beautiful interactive **Streamlit app** in Colab using **ngrok**

---

## 🚀 Features

* Trained on 6 emotions: 😠 Anger, 😨 Fear, 😊 Joy, ❤️ Love, 😢 Sadness, 😲 Surprise
* Emoji + Emotion output with confidence percentage
* All inference and training done in Google Colab (GPU enabled)
* App runs in browser via ngrok URL

---

## 🗃 Dataset

We use the **Crowdflower Emotion Dataset**.
Included inside `emotion-dataset/`:

* `train.txt`
* `val.csv`
* `test.csv`

## 🧠 Model Training (Run in Colab)

1. Open `emotion_detection_project.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Set **Runtime > Change Runtime Type > GPU**
3. Run all cells step-by-step (includes tokenization, training, evaluation, inference)

---

## 🌐 Running Streamlit App in Colab

### 1. Upload the `app.py` file in Colab session

### 2. Install and run app:

```bash
!pip install -q streamlit pyngrok
!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

### 3. Click the URL generated by `localtunnel` to open the app.

✅ Optional: For persistent ngrok URLs, set your authtoken:

```bash
!ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN
```

## 💡 Sample Messages for Testing

* "I'm so happy today!" → 😊 Joy
* "This is the worst day ever." → 😠 Anger
* "I can't believe this happened!" → 😲 Surprise
* "I feel like crying..." → 😢 Sadness
* "I think I'm falling in love." → ❤️ Love
* "I'm terrified of what's coming." → 😨 Fear

---

## 📌 Notes

* The model was trained on 6 emotions only (no Neutral class)
* All training and inference was performed in Colab using GPU
* The app uses localtunnel (or ngrok) to make Streamlit available in browser
